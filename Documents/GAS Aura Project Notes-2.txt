Section 3 - Intro to the Gameplay Ability System
=================================================

GAS Basics:
* Attributes & Abilities

* Attributes:
  Examples: Life, Damage, Critical Hit Chance

* Abilities:
  Examples: Play Animation, Cause Damage, Gain XP, Level up

* Effects:
  Change Attribute Values
  e.g. Buffs, Debuffs can be applied

* Cues:
  Visual & Audio Cues, e.g. Particles and Sounds

Notes:
* GAS is fully replicated
* Easily scalable
* The Gameplay Ability System was originally built for the game Paragon

============================================================
16. The Main Parts of GAS

1. Ability System Component
2. Attribute Set
3. Gameplay Ability
4. Ability Task
5. Gameplay Effect
6. Gameplay Cue
7. Gameplay Tag



* Ability System Component:
  * Added to an actor
  * Granting abilities
  * Handling Notifications
  * Must be added to a character in order for a character to use GAS

* Attribute Set
  * Attributes stored in the attribute set
  * Life, Mana, etc
  * Store attributes on attribute set

* Gameplay Ability
  * Classes used to encapsulate the functionality of "things" a character can do

* Abilty Task
  * Asychronous
  * the "workers"

* Gameplay Effect
  * Change abilities

* Gameplay Cue
  * Particle effects and sounds
  * Handles replication of these

* Gameplay Tag
  * These are not uniquely GAS 
  * These exist outside of GAS
  * Extremely useful and used throughout GAS
  * Example: Abilities.Lightning.Shock


You can add an Ability System Component and an Attribute Set to:
* Pawn
* Player State

Note:
* If you put it on the Pawn and the Pawn is destroyed, to ASC and AS are also destroyed!
* So it is better to put on the Player State (which persists when the Pawn is destroyed)
* Also putting on the Player State keeps the character class cleaner
* However, putting the GAS stuff on an AI might be simpler.

In this project:

Enemy Character
* An Enemy Character (AuraEnemy) will have the ASC and AS directly on the Enemy Character

Player Controlled Character
* Will have the ASC and AS on the Player State

First Steps:
1. Player State class
2. Ability System Component
3. Attribute Set

============================================================
17. The Player State

Adding Player State

Change Player State used by the game by opening the Game Mode class

Game Mode Blueprint->Classes->Player State Class

Game Mode:     BP_AuraGameMode
Player State:  BP_AuraPlayerState

Our Ability System Component and Attribute Set are going to "live" on the Player State (for the player)

============================================================
18. Ability System Component and Attribute Set

Enable GAS:
In order to use GAS, you must enable the Plugin first:
* Edit->Plugins->Gameplay->Gameplay Abilities
  * Check the box and restart the editor

* This updates the uproject file and enables in the plugin 

-------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTE:
* In order to build the project, you MUST add the following modules in the Aura.Build.cs:

Documentation here:
https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/GameplayAbilitySystem/

From the Docs:
PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "GameplayAbilities", "GameplayTags", "GameplayTasks", "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "InputCore", "HeadMountedDisplay" });

Note that the course adds them to the "PrivateDependencyModuleNames" instead of Public

Modules Documentation:
https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-modules-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.1

https://ikrima.dev/ue4guide/build-guide/build-target-file-demystified/#publicdependencymodulenames-vs-privatedependencymodulenames

NOTE:
* You need to refresh the VS project files after adding module dependencies

-----------------------------------

Creating an ASC class:
* Content Browser->Right-click->New C++ Class->ActorComponent->GameplayTasksComponent->AbilitySystemComponent
  * Subclass of UAbilitySystemComponent, which is ultimately a UActorComponent

Creating an Attribute Set:
* Content Browser->Right-click->New C++ Class->Object->AttributeSet
  * Subclass of UAttributeSet


AuraAbilitySystemComponent
* This will be the base class for all ASC's in the project

AuraAttributeSet
* Attribute Set for the project
