GAS Project Notes
=================================

==================================================================
General Notes:

* When moving C++ files around, make sure you delete Intermediate and Binaries directories. Then Genereate VS Project files.
* Can create a derived C++ Blueprint class by right-clicking on the C++ Class in the Content Browser and click "Create C++ class derived from X"

TObjectPtr:
* Has access tracking and lazy loading
* Standard is to use TObjectPtr for member variables

EditAnywhere:

==================================================================
4. Base Character Class
Base Character Class for Game:
* AuraCharacterBase
  * UCLASS(Abstract)
  * Reference:
    * /Script/CoreUObject.Class'/Script/Aura.AuraCharacterBase'


Player Character:
/Script/Engine.Blueprint'/Game/Blueprints/Character/Aura/BP_AuraCharacter.BP_AuraCharacter'
C:/Dev/Unreal-Projects/GAS_Aura/Content/Blueprints/Character/Aura/BP_AuraCharacter.uasset

NOTE:

USceneComponent::SetupAttachment() adds the parent and optional socket name to attach to when a scenecomponent is added. (that is, it specifies what the new SceneComponent is being attached TO)

Example:
	TObjectPtr<USkeletalMeshComponent> Weapon;
	...
	Weapon = CreateDefaultSubobject<USkeletalMeshComponent>("Weapon");
	Weapon->SetupAttachment(GetMesh(), FName("WeaponHandSocket"));
	-> Here, the Weapon SkeletalMeshComponent is attaching itself to the Mesh inherited from the ACharacter.


==================================================================
6. Character Blueprint

Selected Mesh in Blueprint Components (inherited from ACharacter)
* 

Adding Weapon / Socket to BP_AuraCharacter:

* Added socket to hand_l in the SKM_Aura SkeletalMesh
  * Open / Edit the SkeletalMesh
  * In the Skeleton Tree, select the bone, right click -> Add Socket.
  * Named the socket EXACTLY as named in the C++: WeaponHandSocket
    * Weapon->SetupAttachment(GetMesh(), FName("WeaponHandSocket"));
  * We can visualize/position the new socket by right click -> Add Preview Asset -> SKM_Staff
    * Rotate the WeaponHandSocket by -90 so it faces forward
  * To preview with an animation:
    * Preview Scene tab: Animation -> Preview Controller -> Use Specific Animation
      * For testing, used Cast_FireBolt.
      * Moved the weaponHandSocket around so it looked better in Aura's hand

* Back in the BP_AuraCharacter, select the Weapon SkeletalMeshComponent:
  * Change Skeletal Mesh Asset to Staff

Did same with BP_Goblin_Spear
