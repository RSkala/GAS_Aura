GAS Project Notes
=================================

https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-gas-top-down-rpg

==================================================================
General Notes:

* When moving C++ files around, make sure you delete Intermediate and Binaries directories. Then Genereate VS Project files.
* Can create a derived C++ Blueprint class by right-clicking on the C++ Class in the Content Browser and click "Create C++ class derived from X"

TObjectPtr:
* Has access tracking and lazy loading
* Standard is to use TObjectPtr for member variables

EditAnywhere:

==================================================================
4. Base Character Class

Base Character Class for Game:
* AuraCharacterBase
  * UCLASS(Abstract)
  * Reference:
    * /Script/CoreUObject.Class'/Script/Aura.AuraCharacterBase'


Player Character:
/Script/Engine.Blueprint'/Game/Blueprints/Character/Aura/BP_AuraCharacter.BP_AuraCharacter'
C:/Dev/Unreal-Projects/GAS_Aura/Content/Blueprints/Character/Aura/BP_AuraCharacter.uasset

NOTE:

USceneComponent::SetupAttachment() adds the parent and optional socket name to attach to when a scenecomponent is added. (that is, it specifies what the new SceneComponent is being attached TO)

Example:
	TObjectPtr<USkeletalMeshComponent> Weapon;
	...
	Weapon = CreateDefaultSubobject<USkeletalMeshComponent>("Weapon");
	Weapon->SetupAttachment(GetMesh(), FName("WeaponHandSocket"));
	-> Here, the Weapon SkeletalMeshComponent is attaching itself to the Mesh inherited from the ACharacter.


==================================================================
6. Character Blueprint

Selected Mesh in Blueprint Components (inherited from ACharacter)
* 

Adding Weapon / Socket to BP_AuraCharacter:

* Added socket to hand_l in the SKM_Aura SkeletalMesh
  * Open / Edit the SkeletalMesh
  * In the Skeleton Tree, select the bone, right click -> Add Socket.
  * Named the socket EXACTLY as named in the C++: WeaponHandSocket
    * Weapon->SetupAttachment(GetMesh(), FName("WeaponHandSocket"));
  * We can visualize/position the new socket by right click -> Add Preview Asset -> SKM_Staff
    * Rotate the WeaponHandSocket by -90 so it faces forward
  * To preview with an animation:
    * Preview Scene tab: Animation -> Preview Controller -> Use Specific Animation
      * For testing, used Cast_FireBolt.
      * Moved the weaponHandSocket around so it looked better in Aura's hand

* Back in the BP_AuraCharacter, select the Weapon SkeletalMeshComponent:
  * Change Skeletal Mesh Asset to Staff

Did same with BP_Goblin_Spear

/Script/Engine.Blueprint'/Game/Blueprints/Character/Goblin_Spear/BP_Goblin_Spear.BP_Goblin_Spear'

==================================================================
7. Animation Blueprints

Create Animation Blueprint
* Right click -> Animation -> Animation Blueprint
* Choose a Skeleton asset:  SK_Aura
* Created file:  ABP_Aura

Creating Animation Graph:
* Right click AnimGraph -> State Machine
* Run the State Machine through a Slot before connecting to "Output Pose"
* Slots are for playing Montages

Blend Space
-> Find in the Asset Browser in the Animation Blueprint

Note that the IdleWalkRun BlendSpace was already created.
This saved time for the course.
TODO: How to create a BlendSpace

Event Graph:
* Override - Blueprint Initialize Animation 
* Get Character Movement , on Variables -> Character in Event Graph
* The purpose of this was so we could access the Character Movement Component in Blueprint Update Animation
* Set the "GroundSpeed" variable from the Character Movement's XY Velocity
* Use the GroundSpeed variable to "drive" the BlendSpace

BP_AuraCharacter:
* Select the Mesh, then set the AnimClass to ABP_Aura

---------------
Enemies
* For enemies, we will make a "Template" Animation Blueprint to be used for all of our enemy animation blueprints
* Right Click -> Animation -> Animation Blueprint -> Template tab

This is set up just like Aura, EXCEPT:
* In the AnimgGraph, in the "Main States", instead of dragging an IdleWalkRun BlendSpace in a:
  * Add a "Blend Space Player" -- a generic node.
Windows: Event Graph, Anim Graph, State (for IdleWalkRun)

ABP_Enemy
-> ABP_Goblin_Spear
   * Window -> Asset Override Editor
   * ABP_Enmy->AnimGraph->Main States->IdleWalkRun->Blendspace Player-> BS_GoblinSpear_IdleRun 

BP_Goblin_Spear
* Mesh -> Animation -> Animation Class -> ABP_Goblin_Spear

BP_Goblin_Slingshot + ABP_Goblin_Slingshot
