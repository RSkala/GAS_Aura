Section 5 - RPG Game UI
========================

============================================================
27. Game UI Architecture

* Model, View, Controller

Widgets:
* UUserWidget

Model, View, Controller:
3 Different Domains:
* View: Widgets, UI elements
* Model: Data that drives the widgets
* Controller: Responsible for retrieving data from the model and passing to the view (Widget Controller)

Classes to build:
* UAuraUserWidget
* UAuraWidgetController
* AAuraHUD

============================================================
28. Aura User Widget and Widget Controller

* AuraUserWidget
* AuraWidgetController

Create a C++ Widget:
* New C++ Class->All Classes->Visual->Widget->User Widget

Widget Controller:
* Just a simple Object:
* New C++ Class->Object

The WidgetController will not know what widgets its associated with.
The Widgets will know what their controller is.

============================================================
29. Globe Progress Bar

Event Pre Construct:
* Called before the game starts
* For configuring how a widget is supposed to look

WBP_GlobeProgressBar (Widget Blueprint)
SizeBox
* Size: Desired
* Child Layout:
  * Width Override:  250
  * Height Override: 250
  * Overlay: Everything gets stacked under this. This is what Overlays are good for.
    * Image
    * Progress Bar
      * Style -> 
        * Fill Image, changed fill color and opacity to white (so the image shows)
        * Draw As: Change from "Box" to "Image"
        * Background Image -> Tint -> Alpha = 0 (to hide the background)
        * Bar Fill Type: Bottom to Top


SizeBox
 |- Overlay
     |- Image
     |- Progress Bar
     |- Image

Widgets:
* Event Pre Construct
  * This allows you to set and preview changes in your widget

NOTE:
* Create a function from a bunch of selected nodes:
* Select all, Right-Click, then Collapse to Function


Brush-> Use for images in Widgets
* Type: Structure - Slate Brush

For the Image, we exposed as a variable, and called Set Brush using a variable we created named Background Brush
In the Details of the Background Brush variable, we set the Default value to some Ring texture

============================================================
30. Health Globe

WBP_Overlay
 |- Canvas Panel

Note:
* Canvas Panel is more expensive so use them sparingly if possible
* Use SizeBox and Overlay when possible, as they are more efficient (e.g. like WBP_GlobeProgressBar)

To quickly view what the overlay will look in the game, edit the Level Blueprint:
* Open Level Blueprint and open Graph
* In Event BeginPlay, Right-click->User Interface->Create Widget
* Set the Class to WBP_Overlay
* Drag off from the Return Value and select Add to Viewport

To make variables Instance-editable:
* Click the eyeball icon (so it is an open eye). Now you can edit the globe in the overlay.

============================================================
31. Aura HUD

Set HUD Class in Game Mode
* Open the Game Mode -> Classes -> HUD Class

Create HUD Class:
* New C++ Class -> HUD

Note:
* AHUD is NOT a widget blueprint. It derives from AActor.

In order to select the WidgetClass, select the Class Defaults tab:

	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
	TSubclassOf<class UAuraUserWidget> OverlayWidgetClass;

EditAnywhere seems to allow private access in the class

============================================================
32. Overlay Widget Controller

USTRUCT:
* Basically a C++ struct with reflection
* USTRUCT objects are NOT handled by garbage collection

More info on USTRUCT:
https://medium.com/@wojtek.zinczuk/hey-guys-a14f5e770045

We will only have one OverlayWidgetController.
We will put the OWC in the HUD (AuraHUD)

Moving WidgetController initialization out of AAuraHUD::BeginPlay as we need access to the widget controller params

checkf:
* just like check but also prints a formatted string to the crash log

checkf(OverlayWidgetClass, TEXT("Overlay Widget Class unitialized. Fill out BP_AuraHUD"));
checkf(OverlayWidgetControllerClass, TEXT("Overlay Widget Controller Class unitialized. Fill out BP_AuraHUD"));

----
When is AAuraHUD::InitOverlay ready with everything?
* When are where are all the key variables initialized?
* My guess:
  * PossessedBy (server, although widgets shouldnt be created on server)
  * OnRep_PlayerState (client)
    * AcknowledgePossession (client, but not on this project because of settings)

AAuraCharacter::InitAbilityActorInfo

HUD is accessible from the PlayerController

Remember:
* On the server, the server has ALL of the player controllers.
* On a client, the client ONLY has its OWN player controller. The others will be null.

BP_AuraHUD
* Set OverlayWidgetClass here

Confirm that the widget controller was set:

We added this to AAuraUserWidget:

	// We need a BeginPlay-like function to call as soon as the WidgetController is set
	UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent)
	void WidgetControllerSet();

So we can add this event in the Blueprint Graph to check if valid
