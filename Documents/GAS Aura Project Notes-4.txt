Section 5 - RPG Game UI
========================

============================================================
27. Game UI Architecture

* Model, View, Controller

Widgets:
* UUserWidget

Model, View, Controller:
3 Different Domains:
* View: Widgets, UI elements
* Model: Data that drives the widgets
* Controller: Responsible for retrieving data from the model and passing to the view (Widget Controller)

Classes to build:
* UAuraUserWidget
* UAuraWidgetController
* AAuraHUD

============================================================
28. Aura User Widget and Widget Controller

* AuraUserWidget
* AuraWidgetController

Create a C++ Widget:
* New C++ Class->All Classes->Visual->Widget->User Widget

Widget Controller:
* Just a simple Object:
* New C++ Class->Object

The WidgetController will not know what widgets its associated with.
The Widgets will know what their controller is.

============================================================
29. Globe Progress Bar

Event Pre Construct:
* Called before the game starts
* For configuring how a widget is supposed to look

WBP_GlobeProgressBar (Widget Blueprint)
SizeBox
* Size: Desired
* Child Layout:
  * Width Override:  250
  * Height Override: 250
  * Overlay: Everything gets stacked under this. This is what Overlays are good for.
    * Image
    * Progress Bar
      * Style -> 
        * Fill Image, changed fill color and opacity to white (so the image shows)
        * Draw As: Change from "Box" to "Image"
        * Background Image -> Tint -> Alpha = 0 (to hide the background)
        * Bar Fill Type: Bottom to Top


SizeBox
 |- Overlay
     |- Image
     |- Progress Bar
     |- Image

Widgets:
* Event Pre Construct
  * This allows you to set and preview changes in your widget

NOTE:
* Create a function from a bunch of selected nodes:
* Select all, Right-Click, then Collapse to Function


Brush-> Use for images in Widgets
* Type: Structure - Slate Brush

For the Image, we exposed as a variable, and called Set Brush using a variable we created named Background Brush
In the Details of the Background Brush variable, we set the Default value to some Ring texture
